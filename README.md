Horticulture
In this project a storytelling dashboard has to be built for Horticulture dataset extracted from data.gov.in and visualize the dataset using Tableau Desktop. Horticulture is the art of cultivating plants in gardens to produce food and medicinal ingredients, or for comfort and ornamental purposes. Horticulturists grow flowers, fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs, as well as ornamental trees and lawns. The aim of this project is to analyze the crop production based on various parameters. Once the necessary sheets are created and visualized, the dashboard and story is created using Tableau Desktop and the same has been publicized to Tableau Public.
